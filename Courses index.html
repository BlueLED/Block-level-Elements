          <h2>What will I study?</h2>
          <aside><img src="assets/students.jpeg" alt="Students"/></aside>
          <p>In Year 1 you will study a common set of modules that will provide a solid foundation for the second and third years of your degree. You will study a balanced range of current computing topics from fundamentals of analysis and construction of systems to the foundations of computer science. Part of your first year studies will look at career options within the Computing and IT industry to help you select your second and third year modules. Your personal tutor will also be able to advise you.</p>

            <h3>Year 1</h3>
            <dl>
              <dt>CIS1100 Computer Systems in a Digital World (40 credits)</dt>
              <dd>CIS1100 explores how the world of the 21st century is underpinned by computing technology while challenging you to envision possible future developments as computing professionals. The module discusses how current networked applications operate and analyses the technology on which they depend, starting with Internet-enabled information systems and progressing to the underpinning database, network and computer architecture. The module includes practical activities on hardware, software and networks and will develop your skills in writing, presenting and the use of electronic tools for research.<

              <dt>CIS1002 Programming: Concepts to Construction (30 credits)</dt>
              <dd>CIS1002 offers a practical introduction to the fundamentals of an object-oriented approach to software development. You will be introduced to the analytical techniques and processes essential for specifying, designing and implementing applications. Object-orientated concepts and notions are introduced, together with the application of a modern programming language which is widely used in industry.</dd>

              <dt>CIS1007 Web Design and Development (30 credits).</dt>
              <dd>It is vital that you develop a thorough understanding of the use of the Internet as a tool for research and communication. This module will allow you to develop a sound understanding of the World Wide Web, the related technologies, the relationships between them and also their use, which will be a valuable asset in all aspects of work within the web industry. In addition to providing you with the necessary theoretical content, the module also provides a step-by-step guide through the development of a comprehensive web project. You will explore the elements of website design, including colour, typography and imagery, and assemble them together in an effective layout. In addition, the module also provides an appropriate setting to introduce some of the more powerful, user-friendly web development tools widely adopted in the industry.

              <dt>CIS1101 Foundations of Computer Science (20 credits)</dt>
              <dd>CIS1101 introduces you to the concepts and practices of problem solving through a series of innovative class seminars and individual experiments. You will learn to identify a problem, analyse it, and produce a structured solution. The module will explore common problems within computing and enable you to see how separate areas merge, overlap and depend on each other in order for a robust computing system to be developed. Although the focus of the module is specifically on resolving computing problems, the skills and techniques are ubiquitous and therefore highly transferable.</dd>

              <h3>Year 2</h3>
              <dl>
                <dt>CIS2101 Research and Development Methods (20 credits).</dt>
                <dd>The ability to undertake research, to appreciate the different research methods and methodologies, to have knowledge of the sources of information and an understanding of the problems of research are fundamental graduate competencies. This module will familiarise you with the main methods of research and the contexts in which they are conducted. It will also help you comprehend the principles and perspectives of research. The module will provide practical experience in the use of research methods and help you to gain confidence and experience in the research process.</dd>

                <dt>CIS2107 Web Scripting (20 credits).</dt>
                <dd>The Internet and the Web have become increasingly complex environments and as a result, there has been an ever-growing demand from users to experience a ‘wow’ factor when visiting websites. This can be achieved, in part, through a dynamic, animated and interactive environment, where information can be presented in a more visually interactive way. Such environments require technologies that go beyond the HTML standard, making use of client-side scripting languages to allow users to interact in a much more visual way. This module will expose you to the basics of client-side scripting. You will develop an understanding of the tools and techniques needed to implement a dynamic client presentation and make use of emerging technologies, such as XML and AJAX, which are now commonplace within the industry.</dd>
